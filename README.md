A node.js command line app that lets users add and view departments, roles, and employees. It also allows users to update the roles of employees. To launch the app, simply type:
```
node index
```
The app uses the `mysql2` npm package to store all information in a MySQL server and `inquirer` to prompt the user for names and salaries.
